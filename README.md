# AIML-Supervised-Learning-project
I have built a project on Heart_disease prediction using ML 

# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and it includes various features related to health and medical conditions.

## Algorithms Used
The project employs the following machine learning algorithms for classification:

Logistic Regression: A linear model used to predict the probability of a binary outcome.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification based on the majority of the k-nearest data points.

Random Forest Classification: An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It includes a comprehensive set of features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more, aiming to capture various factors that may contribute to heart disease.

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using the following:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


# Usage
## Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AIML-Supervised-Learning-project.git
cd AIML-Supervised-Learning-project


## Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script:

jupyter notebook  # or python main_script.py
Results

The project includes visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to help understand the patterns in the data and the decisions made by the machine learning models.

# Future Work
Feature engineering and selection for improved model performance.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters for each algorithm.
Exploring additional machine learning algorithms.
Deployment of the model as a web application.
